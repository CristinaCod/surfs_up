## Overview
### Purpose


## Results
•	It is my opinion that the most important thing to note from the analysis is that the average temperatures for both June and December are just a few degrees shy of being equal with the mean for June being 75 and December 4 degrees lower at 71.

•	As expected, based on the findings of the average temperatures we also see the max temps very close in number as well with a high of 85 in June and 83 in December.

•	The only time we see a vast difference in the two months is when we compare total counts with June at 1,700 and December almost 200 less at 1,517.
