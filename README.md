# Surfs Up
## Overview
### Purpose
Ever since a trip to Hawaii last year where I discovered a newfound love of surfing, I have made it my mission to go back and make Hawaii my home. In order to support this venture and make a living I proposed the idea of opening a surf n’ shake shop. W.Avy, an investor and surfing enthusiast,  has decided to take a chance on my start-up but in doing so he first requires a weather analysis to ensure the success of the shop.

The purpose of this analysis is to prove to W. Avy the sustainability of the surf n’ shake shop on Oahu throughout the entirety of the year by running queries on temperature trends for the months of June and December.

## Results
•	It is my opinion that the most important thing to note from the analysis is that the average temperatures for both June and December are just a few degrees shy of being equal with the mean for June being 75 and December 4 degrees lower at 71.

•	As expected, based on the findings of the average temperatures we also see the max temps very close in number as well with a high of 85 in June and 83 in December.

•	The only time we see a vast difference in the two months is when we compare total counts with June at 1,700 and December almost 200 less at 1,517. 

## Summary
Based on the analysis we can see that regardless of the season the surf n' shake shop will flourish as the average temperature in Hawaii is fairly equal year round. If we wanted to be 100% sure of this we could easily run queries on each month out of the year and convert the data into a bar graph for presentation to investors.

### Follow-Up
After launching the surf n' shake shop in Oahu, the next proposal to W. Avy would be for an expansion and to possibly make the shop into a chain. If things go well the queries for this analysis can be repurposed to determine sustainability on other islands such as Maui or Kauai.

To expand the analysis we can also look at precipitation rates as the weather does tend to effect the activities people participate in on a day to day basis. It would also be smart to account for severe weather like tropical storms. The shop would have to be located somewhere where weather damage wouldn't be a major concern.

It would also be interesting to analyze tide charts to determine the times waves would be the biggest which would help us anticipate when we'll be the busiest during the day so we can prepare for a rush.
